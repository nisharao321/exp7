Q 1. Which of the following parameter will affect the pressure drop due to shock loss in the mine?
<br>
a. Total pressure drop in the mine<br>
b. Frictional pressure drop in the mine<br>
<b>c. Both a & b </b><br>
d. None of these<br><br>

Q 2. On the basis of above experiment, which of the following parameters are not going to change on increasing the volume of the air?<br>
a. Velocity of air flow<br>
b. Total pressure drop<br>
c. Frictional pressure drop<br>
<b>d. None of the above</b><br>

Q 3. Which of the following statement is false? <br>
a. Shock loss factor is directly proportional to the P<sub>shock</sub><br>
<b>b. Shock loss factor is inversely proportional to the square of the area of the cross section of the duct</b><br>
c. Shock loss factor is inversely proportional to the square of the quantity of air flow through the duct<br>
d. Shock loss factor is inversely proportional to density of the air<br>

Q 4. What are the processes which leads to the development of Shock loss pressure at the bends? <br>
a. Constriction of airways at bends and hence contraction of air takes place<br>
b. Formation of eddies around the bends, intensity being more at corners<br>
c. Expansion of airways after the bend and hence expansion of air taking place<br>
<b>d. All of the above</b><br>

Q 5. Which of the following have the largest Equivalent length of bends?<br>
<b>a. Sharp bend, acute</b><br>
b. Rounded  bend, acute<br>
c. Sharp bend, right angle<br>
d. Sharp bend, obtuse angle<br>
